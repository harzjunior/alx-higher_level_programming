### Attention: Line Ending Conversion for Unix Compatibility

It has come to my notice that the file exhibits Windows-style line endings (CRLF), which may pose issues on Unix-like systems. To address this, follow the steps below:

1. Convert line endings to Unix style (LF) using the `dos2unix` command. If not installed, you can install it with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install dos2unix
   ```

2. Run `dos2unix` on your script:

   ```bash
   dos2unix 0-body_size.sh
   ```

3. Attempt to run your script again:

   ```bash
   ./0-body_size.sh 0.0.0.0:5000
   ```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve any interpreter errors caused by incompatible line endings.
